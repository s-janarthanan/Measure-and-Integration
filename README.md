# Measure theory assignment

This is a jupyter notebook (python code) showing how we can approximate a general non-negative measurable function by non-negative simple measurable functions. 
Simple functions are a finite linear combination of characteristic functions, and we can iteratively approximate general functions using them. 
I had done this as a part of my coursework on Measure and Integration from the Math Department at IIT Madras, in the Jan-May 2025 semester.
